    #  Calculate increments and levy area  #
    ########################################
    #
    # This is a little bit convoluted, so here's an explanation.
    #
    # The entry point is increment_and_levy_area, below. This immediately calls _increment_and_space_time_levy_area,
    # applies the space-time to full Levy area correction, and then returns.
    #
    # _increment_and_space_time_levy_area in turn calls a central LRU cache, as (later on) we'll need the increment and
    # space-time Levy area of the parent interval to compute our own increment and space-time Levy area, and it's likely
    # that our parent exists in the cache, as if we're being queried then our parent was probably queried recently as
    # well.
    # Note that we don't call the cache directly because the global BrownianInterval overrides
    # _increment_and_space_time_levy_area to return its own increment and space-time Levy area, effectively holding them
    # permanently in the cache.
    # If the request isn't found in the LRU cache then it heads into increment_and_space_time_levy_area_uncached.
    #
    # Now it turns out that the size of our increment and space-time Levy area is really most naturally thought of as a
    # property of our parent: it depends on our parent's increment, space-time Levy area, and whether we are the left or
    # right interval within our parent. So increment_and_space_time_levy_area_uncached in turn checks if we are on the
    # left or right of our parent and dispatches to the parent.
    #
    # left_increment_and_space_time_levy_area and right_increment_and_space_time_levy_area then really do the
    # calculation. As helper functions, they have _brownian_bridge and _common_levy_computation that factor out their
    # common code.

                If zero dimensional represents a scalar Brownian motion.
                If one dimensional represents a batch of scalar Brownian motions.
                If >two dimensional the last dimension represents the size of a
                a multidimensional Brownian motion, and all previous dimensions
                represent batch dimensions.
            dtype (torch.dtype): The dtype of each Brownian sample.
                Defaults to the PyTorch default.
            device (str or torch.device): The device of each Brownian sample.
                Defaults to the CPU.
            entropy (int): Global seed, defaults to `None` for random entropy.
            dt (float or Tensor): The expected average step size of the SDE
                solver. Set it if you know it (e.g. when using a fixed-step
                solver); else it will default to equal the first step this is
                evaluated with. This allows us to set up a structure that should
                be efficient to query at these intervals.
            pool_size (int): Size of the pooled entropy. If you care about
                statistical randomness then increasing this will help (but will

            cache_size (int): How big a cache of recent calculations to use.

                things up dramatically, rather than recomputing things.)
                The default is set to be pretty close to the optimum: smaller
                values imply more recalculation, whilst larger values imply
                more time spent keeping track of the cache.
            levy_area_approximation (str): Whether to also approximate Levy
                area. Defaults to 'none'. Valid options are 'none',
                'space-time', 'davie' or 'foster', corresponding to different
